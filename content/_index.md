Hi! I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at Aalto University. Despite being very early on in my studies, I have already some experience in the industry as a summer trainee at a well-known tech company.  

Computer Science is a very fascinating subject. It allows me to challenge myself in various ways, which is one of many reasons I wanted to study this subject in particular. I am interested in many different fields, but my main points of interest are AI, Data Science, Cybersecurity and DevOps.  

I have many hobbies too, music being the most important. I also like strategy games and team sports, football in particular.
