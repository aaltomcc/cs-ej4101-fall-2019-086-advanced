## this course 086
I took this course as it was recommended as a good introduction to DevOps by the professor of the Software Project course. DevOps practices will be very important later in our software projects, so I believed it to be a good idea to study it beforehand. Furthermore, I am very interested in modern SW development practices, and DevOps belongs to that category.  

I came into the course knowing the basic idea of DevOps: A set of practices/tools that combine SW development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops), with the aim of shortening SDLC and provide CI/CD with high SW quality. I know of some CI/CD tools through work (Jenkins, Gerrit, JIRA and Confluence), but I was unfamiliar with the practices of DevOps, and I wanted to get a better understanding of these practices in particular.

There are many things I wished to learn coming into the project:
* Why DevOps is being used today.
* Approaches to implementing DevOps in the most optimal way possible for an organization.
* Understanding the statement _DevOps is a culture_ that I have seen used frequently.
* The processes involved in setting up CI/CD pipelines and the terminology and precise definitions of relevant concepts, such as build, deployment, automation. 
* Various tools used to make SW development more efficient and sustainable, in addition to those I learned at work.
* The use containers and virtual machines in CI/CD and/or testing.

Having had a lot of questions about DevOps, I felt that this course would be the perfect opportunity to get a better grasp on the core elements of DevOps, which will most likely be of great use in my future studies and work.
