## this course 086
I am taking this course as it was recommended as a good introduction to DevOps by the professor of the Software Project course. DevOps practices will be very important later on in our software projects, so I believe it is a good idea to study it beforehand. Furthermore, I am very interested in modern SW development practices, and DevOps belongs to that category.  

I came into the course knowing the basic idea of DevOps.
